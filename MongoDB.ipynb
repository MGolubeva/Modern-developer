    "$\\quad$ Every day we deal with information: looking TV, reading newspapers or magazines, posting on any social network, etc. It has become commonplace for us, so we even stopped to notice how much information goes through us.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ According to [IDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Corporation), in 2011 we created 1.8 zettabytes (or 1.8 trillion GBs) of information, which is enough data to fill about 57.5 billion 32GB Apple iPads. That's enough iPads to build a Great iPad Wall of China two times higher than the original one. In 2012 it reached 2.8 zettabytes and IDC now forecasts that we will generate 40 zettabytes (ZB) by 2020. Every day we create data, that comes from everywhere: sensors used to gather climate information, posts to social media sites, digital pictures and videos and cell phone GPS signals to name a few. In average every minute of every day we create:\n",
    "* more than 204 million email messages;\n",
    "* over 2 million Google search queries;\n",
    "* 48 hours of new YouTube videos; \n",
    "* 684,000 bits of content shared on Facebook; \n",
    "* more than 100,000 tweets; \n",
    "* `$`272,000 spent on e-commerce, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ These figures, mildly speaking, look just awful. In this connection a natural question arises: where and how can we store this data?<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ Databases have been created for this aim as organized collections of data. Today we know a lot of databases and systems of its management varying by its type, structure, and architecture. But the establishment of databases in this form, as we know and use it today, dates back to the 1950s. However, the need to store and sort the data appeared much earlier.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ The first large-scale database management system (shortly DBMS, it handles the way data is stored, maintained, and retrieved) was the Information Management System (IMS) created by IBM in the mid to late 1960's to support the Apollo space missions. It was even before hard drives were invented! IMS has used a hierarchal structure to store data in a tree structure. IMS offers very fast transactional support and is still in use today.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ The further development of programming languages, algebra, and relational calculus led to the creation of **SEQUEL** language (**S**tructured **E**nglish **Q**uery **L**anguage). Promotion of this language to version 2 led to the emergence of a structured query language (**SQL**). This language was approved in 1987 and established as ISO and ANSI standard. This concept remained the king among other approaches for data storage and its management many decades of the year and saves its positions even today in many leading fields. <br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ There was a certain shift in the perception of data at the turn of the millennium. Boundaries in approach built on a structured data model (relational/object-oriented model) and object application are emerging that leads to dusting off the idea of the unstructured database called today **NoSQL**. The boom of unstructured databases associated with Google, which introduced its proposal called BigTable database, intended for the large amounts of data. The biggest difference between SQL and NoSQL was that the last ones were not line-oriented like SQL databases, but column-oriented. <br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ The modern world was divided into different directions concerning both SQL and NoSQL concepts and today there are discussions about what kind of database is better. But it is clear that in an era of tremendous prosperity and demand for the technologies to work with Big Data, NoSQL is a favorite in this competition.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ This lesson opens the door to the world of one of the common used NoSQL databases, called MongoDB. Our journey through this world will last 8 weeks and during this time you will be able to know and understand all its beauty. Good luck!<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ So, as mentioned above, in the world of database technology there are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL - or, relational databases and non-relational databases. The difference speaks to how they are built, the type of information they store, and how do they store it. Relational databases are structured like phone books that store phone numbers and addresses. Non-relational databases are mostly document-oriented and distributed like file folders that hold everything from the person’s address to its shopping history. SQL and NoSQL databases are called due to the fact whether or not they’re written solely in structured query language (SQL). \n",
    "### SQL databases\n",
    "$\\quad$ The relational (SQL) database is more rigid, structured way of storing data, like a phone book or well-known Excel table. It consists of one or more tables with columns (fields) and rows (records), where each row represents an entry, and each column sorts a very specific type of information like name, age, profession, address or phone number. The relationship between tables and field types is called a *schema*. In a relational database schema has to be clearly defined before any information can be added.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ In fact, the relational database was born in 1970 when *E.F. Codd*, an IBM researcher, wrote a paper outlining the process. Since that time, relational databases have grown in popularity to become a standard.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ With a relational database, you can quickly compare information because of the arrangement of data in columns. The relational database model takes advantage of this uniformity to build completely new tables out of required information from existing tables. In other words, it uses the relationship of similar data to increase the speed and versatility of the database.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ Today there are few decades of Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), but [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation), [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL), [Microsoft SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server), [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL), [MariaDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB) and [IBM DB2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DB2) are the most popular. <br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ So let’s look how the data can be structured and represented in an SQL database. Suppose we have a list of books of several authors we have read or want to read. We can write data about book’s name, author, genre and year of writing to the table like this\n",
    "\n",
    "|author|book|genre|year|\n",
    "|------|----|-----|----|\n",
    "|Jack London|The Sea Wolf|adventure|1904|\n",
    "|Jack London|Martin Eden|adventure|1909|\n",
    "|Agatha Christie|The Mystery of the Blue Train|detective|1928|\n",
    "|Mark Twain|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer|adventure|1876|\n",
    "|Mark Twain|The Prince and the Pauper|children literature|1881|\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ For this table we can apply a lot of various operations - sort rows, filter records, find the earliest publication or other aggregation etc.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ This table contains more complicated records than the first example with people’s addresses and phones because possesses with multiple records. With this short example, we want to demonstrate how such data may be organized in SQL database. The basic concept of the data storage is **identifier** or **ID**. Each record in the table automatically gets its own ID when it was created. Usually, tables contain a lot of records with the same value of a field; in the previous table, they were “author” columns, containing two pairs of the same authors names (Jack London and Mark Twain) and the “genre” column. Best practice, in this case, is to separate one table into several tables with unique records for each column with duplicates. For the current example, an SQL database will contain three tables: “authors”, “books” and “genres” (see the picture below).<br/>\n",
    "<img src=\"1470660798942.png\">\n",
    "$\\quad$ The table “authors” consists of all unique authors mentioned above as well as the table “genres” contains all unique genres. In the “books” table, instead of the column “author” the column “author_id” was defined, it has the relationship with the “authors” table by the pair of fields “author_id” (“books”) ↔ “id” (“authors”). By the way, such type of relationship between two tables is called one-to-many (one2m) because one author can write a lot of books (we suppose that a book may have only one author). The field determining the relationship of one table with another one is called **Primary Key**. It is one of the fundamental concepts of relational databases. Particularly, “books” table contains two Primary Keys - “author_id” and “genre_id”.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ It was very simple but at the same time very informative example how the data can be organized in some SQL database. In order to the relational database to be effective, it must have a very organized data storage structure. A well-designed schema minimizes data redundancy and prevents tables from becoming out-of-sync, a critical feature for many businesses, especially those that record financial transactions. \n",
    "### NoSQL databases\n",
    "$\\quad$ If your data requirements aren’t clear at the outset or if you’re dealing with massive amounts of unstructured data, you may not have the luxury of developing a relational database with the clearly defined schema. Think of non-relational databases more like file folders, assembling related information of all types. Unstructured data from the web can include sensor data, social sharing, personal settings, photos, location-based information, online activity, usage metrics and more. Trying to store, process, and analyze all of this unstructured data led to the development of schema-less alternatives to SQL. Taken together, these alternatives are referred to as NoSQL, meaning “Not only SQL”. While the term NoSQL encompasses a broad range of alternatives to relational databases, what they have in common is that they allow you to treat data more flexibly. NoSQL technology was originally created and used by Internet leaders such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and others, who required database management systems that could write and read data anywhere worldwide while scaling and delivering performance across massive data sets and millions of users.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ Instead of tables, NoSQL databases are document-oriented. This way, non-structured data (such as articles, photos, social media data, videos, or content within blog posts) can be stored in a single document that can be easily found but isn’t necessarily categorized into fields like a relational database does. It’s more intuitive, but note, that storing data in bulk like this requires extra processing effort and more storage than highly organized SQL data.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ NoSQL databases do not have a common way to query the data (i.e. similar to SQL of relational databases) and each solution provides its own query system.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ There are four main types of NoSQL databases:\n",
    " 1. **Key-value model** - the least complex NoSQL option, which stores data in the schema-less way that consists of indexed keys and values. The most popular key-value databases: [Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra), [LevelDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LevelDB), [DynamoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_DynamoDB), and [Riak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riak).\n",
    " 2. **Column store** - stores data tables as columns rather than rows. It’s more than just an inverted table - sectioning out columns allows you to get excellent scalability and high performance. Examples: [HBase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HBase), [BigTable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigtable), [HyperTable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertable).\n",
    " 3. **Document database** - takes the key-value concept and adds more complexity, each document in this type of database has its own data and its own unique key, which is used to retrieve it. It’s a great option for storing, retrieving and managing data that is document-oriented but still somewhat structured. Examples: [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB), [CouchDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchDB).\n",
    " 4. **Graph database** - have data that is interconnected and best represented as a graph. This method is capable of lots of complexity when many complex relationships between data exist. Examples: [Neo4J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j), [Titan](http://titan.thinkaurelius.com/), [OrientDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OrientDB).<br/>\n",
    " \n",
    "$\\quad$ For your general understanding, let’s demonstrate how the records for books from the last example are represented in a graph database. Records of each SQL table represents a single node (circle on the image below). Records from different tables possess by the specific type of nodes, in general. We have used different colors to highlight various types of nodes. The relationships implemented due to primary keys between SQL tables and its records are represented as connections of some type between nodes in graph databases. We’ve called these types as “wrote” (an author wrote a book) and “is_genre_of”.\n",
    "<img src=\"1470665323139.png\">\n",
    "$\\quad$ With this example we wanted only to show that the same data can be structured lots different ways, i.e. there is some freedom of choice of data organization. The idea that SQL and NoSQL are in direct opposition and competition with each other is flawed one, not in the least because many companies opt to use them concurrently. If your data needs are changing rapidly, you need high throughput to handle viral growth or your data is growing fast and you need to be able to scale out quickly and efficiently - maybe NoSQL is for you. But if the data you have isn’t changing in structure and you’re experiencing moderate, manageable growth - your needs may be best met by SQL technologies.\n",
    "## Please, meet MongoDB\n",
    "$\\quad$ So, we have taken a quick look at two main ways of data storage: SQL and NoSQL databases, considered its types and mentioned the most popular databases. As you could see, there are too many various databases and DBMSs, but why we have chosen MongoDB for learning in this course? In this chapter we are going to explain this.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ MongoDB is an open source database written in the C++ programming language that uses a document-oriented data model. Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, MongoDB is built on an architecture of collections and documents. Documents comprise sets of key-value pairs and are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function as the equivalent of relational database tables.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ MongoDB is designed for problems without heavy transactional requirements that aren't easily solved by traditional RDBMSs, including problems which require the database to span a lot of servers. Like other NoSQL databases, MongoDB supports dynamic schema design, allowing the documents in a collection to have different fields and structures. The database uses a document storage and data interchange format called **BSON**, which provides a binary representation of JSON-like documents. Automatic sharding enables data in a collection to be distributed across multiple systems for horizontal scalability as data volumes increase.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ MongoDB was created in 2009 by Dwight Merriman and Eliot Horowitz, who had encountered development and scalability issues with traditional relational database approaches while building Web applications at DoubleClick, an Internet advertising company that is now owned by Google Inc. According to Merriman, the name of the database was derived from the word humongous to represent the idea of supporting large amounts of data.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ The data environment has changed a lot since SQL was first designed in the 1970s, and a few of MongoDB’s most popular uses are great examples of how its NoSQL capabilities can meet the challenges of modern data.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Location-based data analytics and operations.*** If you gather location-based data, MongoDB has built-in spatial functions that allow you to harvest this data from specific locations and put it to use without complicated extraction processes.\n",
    "2. ***The Internet of Things.*** Billions of sensors and connected assets and devices create millions of data points, and it’s a challenge for relational databases to absorb and analyze without time-consuming ETL (extract, transform, and load) processes. MongoDB can analyze data of any kind within the database itself.\n",
    "3. ***Get real-time data reporting and analytics.*** Pull together data from across different silos seamlessly, and get a real-time, snapshot view of your data that you can use. Trying to consolidate different types of data like this with a relational database is a challenge.\n",
    "4. ***Powering content management systems (CMS).*** Whether your CMS is designed for e-commerce or publishing content, MongoDB is an ideal partner because it can house so many different types of data - the data that drives the necessity of a CMS-powered site. \n",
    "5. ***Push out new versions of mobile apps fast.*** MongoDB’s ability to support fast iterations means you can scale up, make modifications, and give your customers new and better apps fast, and without the cost of updating your relational database management system (RDBMS).<br/> \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ Today many large companies use MongoDB. We will provide only a few the most expressive examples: \n",
    "- Bosch has built its Internet of Things suite on MongoDB, bringing the power of big data to a new range of Industrial Internet applications including manufacturing, automotive, retail, energy and many others (in total it collects data from about 40 billion sensors);\n",
    "- the CERN physics lab is using MongoDB for data aggregation;\n",
    "- The New York Times newspaper is using MongoDB to support a form-building application for photo submissions;\n",
    "- an insurance company MetLife is using MongoDB for customer service applications (it built a single view of 100M+ customers and 70 systems in 90 days using MongoDB; they were trying to build the same application with a relational database for many years);\n",
    "- the City of Chicago cuts crime and improves citizen welfare with a real-time geospatial analytics platform called WindyGrid. Using MongoDB, it analyzes data from 30+ different departments – like bus locations, 911 calls, and even tweets – to better understand and respond to emergencies;\n",
    "- Otto, Europe’s second-largest e-commerce company, continually updates its catalog of over 2M products to provide a one-to-one shopping experience for 30M shoppers;\n",
    "- Forbes gains critical insight into the social sharing of their articles, to capitalize on stories going viral in real-time;\n",
    "- Genentech, a biotechnology corporation, accelerates drug research using MongoDB to capture the variety of data, generated by genetic tests.\n",
    "$\\quad$ They were only a small part of all those who and where uses MongoDB, but they show how popular, convenient and functional MongoDB is. A larger list of MongoDB clients you may see on [the official site](https://www.mongodb.com/who-uses-mongodb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## MongoDB architecture and data storage in simple words\n",
    "$\\quad$ MongoDB stores BSON documents, i.e. data records, which are were close by their form, view and structure to JavaScript objects, in collections; the collections in databases. What does it mean we try explaining the above example with books and its authors?<br/> \n",
    "$\\quad$ So we may organize the structure of MongoDB database at least by the next to ways. On the current stage, it is not important for us which one will be better from technical and performance point of view, we only want to demonstrate how these data can be represented in a MongoDB database.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ At first, we create three JSON-like objects for each author:\n",
    "- the first one:\n",
    "```json\n",

    "$\\quad$ and join books by its author into the various collection, i.e. the first two books we will put in the collection “Jack London”, the third document put into the collection “Agatha Christie” and the collection “Mark Twain” will include the last two documents. In this case, the database “authors_db2” has three collections:\n",
    "<img src=\"1470724461105.png\">\n",
    "$\\quad$ Thus, MongoDB documents are composed of field-and-value pairs and have the following structure:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "        {\n",
    "           field1: value1,\n",
    "           field2: value2,\n",
    "           ...\n",
    "           fieldN: valueN\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$\\quad$ The value of a field can be any of the BSON data types, including other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents. We will learn data types available in MongoDB in the next lessons. Documents have the following restrictions on field names:\n",
    "- the field name **`_`id** is reserved for use as a primary key; its value must be unique in the collection and is immutable.\n",
    "- the field names cannot start with the dollar sign (**`$`**) character because this sign is used at aggregation operations.\n",
    "- the field names cannot contain the dot (.) character because this sign is usually used for concatenation with internal fields in nested documents.\n",
    "- the field names cannot contain the null character (i.e. spaces, tabs).\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ BSON documents may have more than one field with the same name, but it may be a problem with working with database data. So, we strongly recommend using all unique name within a document.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ MongoDB documents can vary in structure, so MongoDB possesses by the dynamic schema. For example, all documents that describe users might contain the user ID and the last date they logged into the system. However, only some of these documents might contain the user’s identity for one or more third-party applications. Fields can vary from document to document. If a new field needs to be added to a document, then the field can be created without affecting all other documents in the system.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ Note, the maximum BSON document size is 16 megabytes. It helps ensure that a single document cannot use an excessive amount of RAM or, during transmission, excessive amount of bandwidth. MongoDB memory maps the database files. It allows the OS to control this and allocate the maximum amount of RAM to the memory mapping. As MongoDB updates and reads from the DB, it is reading and writing to RAM. All indexes on the documents in the database are held in RAM also. The files in RAM are flushed to disk every 60 seconds. To prevent data loss in the event of power failure, the default is to run with journaling switched on. The journal file is flushed to disk every 100ms and if there is power loss is used to bring the database back to a consistent state. An important design decision with mongo is the amount of RAM. You need to figure out your working set size, i.e if you are going to be reading and writing to only the most recent 10`%` of your data in the database then this 10`%` is your working set and should be held in memory for maximum performance. So if your working set is, for example, 10GB you are going to need 10GB for max performance. Otherwise, your queries/updates will run slower as pages of memory are paged from disk into memory.<br/> \n",
    "$\\quad$ Other important aspects of MongoDB are replication for backups and sharding for scaling.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ MongoDB provides horizontal scale-out for databases on low cost, commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure using a technique called **sharding**, which is transparent to applications. Sharding distributes data across multiple physical partitions called shards. Sharding allows MongoDB deployments to address the hardware limitations of a single server, such as bottlenecks in RAM or disk I/O, without adding complexity to the application. MongoDB automatically balances the data in the sharded cluster as the data grows or the size of the cluster increases or decreases. Unlike relational databases, sharding is automatic and built into the database, minimizing the burden for developers and operations teams.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ MongoDB maintains multiple copies of data called replica sets using native **replication**. A replica set is a fully self-healing shard that helps prevent database downtime and can be used to scale read operations. Replica failover is fully automated, eliminating the need for administrators to intervene manually. A replica set consists of multiple replicas. At any given time, one member acts as the primary replica set member and the other members act as secondary replica set members. MongoDB is strongly consistent by default. Reads and writes are issued to a primary copy of the data. If the primary member fails for any reason (e.g., hardware failure, network partition), one of the secondary members is automatically elected to primary and begins to process all writes. Replica sets also provide operational flexibility by providing a way to upgrade hardware and software without requiring the database to go offline. This is an important feature, because these types of operations can account for as much as one third of all downtime in traditional systems.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ We will learn both sharding and replication more detailed in the next lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages and disadvantages of MongoDB\n",
    "$\\quad$ Now we can generalize good and bad sides of MongoDB usage and underline when it is better to use it.<br/> \n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "$\\quad$ Below we isolate 5 main features making MongoDB better among many other databases:\n",
    "1. **Schema less.** MongoDB is documented database in which one collection may hold absolutely different documents. A number of fields, content, and size of the document can differ from one document to another. The fields can be added to an existing document at any time, dynamically. No ALTER TABLE queries (which usually take place in SQL databases), no rebuild indexing.\n",
    "2. **Performance.** Suppose we want to collect data about blog posts; each blog post consists of the title, content, and comments. In the relational model, the comment will be stored as an individual table and retrieved by joining post table and comment table. In document model, they are saved as one document. They are treated as a whole. When querying, you get everything from that one document, no reference to other documents, that one document can be identified by an id. Thus get a document is a key value query, not a relational query. Key value query is much faster than a relational query. Joins are the slowest actions in SQL.\n",
    "3. **Scalability.** With MongoDB, it is very easy to scale horizontally. MongoDB supports auto-sharding and auto failover. When the data on one node exceed the threshold, MongoDB automatically rearranges the data to evenly distributed node. \n",
    "4. **Load balancing and sharding.** If you have huge amounts of data or want to distribute the traffic of your database among various machines to balance the load, MongoDB carries a number of advantages over traditional databases. Moreover, sharding, which is MongoDB’s unique approach to fulfilling the requirements of growth in data, makes use of horizontal scaling and allows you to multiple machines for the purpose of supporting the growth of data.\n",
    "5. **Speed.** As all the data is generally at a single location, MongoDB is extremely quick. However, this only stands true when the data you are working on is actually a document. If you are working on a data that emulates relational model, your code will be required to carry out multiple independent queries for the purpose of retrieving the single document and this will make it slower than an RDBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "$\\quad$ Despite the relatively big list of advantages, there are some aspects when MongoDB works worse than some other databases. But today it is considered that it is impossible to build an ideal structure for data storage. This statement is known as [CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem).<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ So here is a list of disadvantages:\n",
    "1. **Usage of memory.** As MongoDB stores the key name along with every document, it naturally consumes more memory. MongoDB using memory mapped file, let the Operating System handle the caching. The size of your database is limited by virtual memory provided by Operating System and hardware. On the 32bit machine, you can only save 4 GB data. For the production environment, a 64bits is a must. If you are playing it on you own 32bit machine, don't save serious data into MongoDB. When the data exceed the capacity, your insertions may fail without any warnings!\n",
    "2. **Not support join operation.** Like a relational database, joins are simply not possible in MongoDB. This is also the trade off in order to be able to easily scale horizontally. But you can always perform your join by making multiple queries.\n",
    "3. **Not support transaction.** To achieve the performance and scalability, MongoDB ditches the transaction support. This makes MongoDB very easy to scale horizontally which utilize a lot of cheap hardware to balance the load. Scale horizontally is generally a hard task in the relational database like MySQL. MongoDB is the best fit if you have a lot of data, but the relation between them is weak. For example, a stream of independent events, actually the early application of MongoDB is to record online ads clicking statistical information. It’s not fit for strongly related data like your bank account information, whenever you transfer money, many related bank data needs to be modified at the same time, and they either all done, or nothing is done. RDBMS do this by the transaction. A transaction is the propagation of one or more changes to the database. For example, if you are creating a record or updating a record or deleting a record from the table, then you perform the transaction on the table.\n",
    "4. **Still under development.** While SQL was developed in the 1980s, MongoDB entered the market in 2009. As a result, MongoDB is not that extensively documented or tested and also lacks the availability of support and experts. But probably it is not a disadvantage, but vice versa.<br/> \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ As you can see, there are both advantages and disadvantages to MongoDB and you can switch to it only if the disadvantages don’t make much of a difference to you. Also, while traditional databases have been used for a long time, MongoDB is pretty new in the industry and does carry a lot of potential for further development. There is a major possibility that MongoDB might be the most advantageous among all the databases in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When we should use MongoDB\n",
    "$\\quad$ At the end of this segment we want to make few recommendations about when and what for we should (or even must) use MongoDB:\n",
    "- if you need to load tons of data lines with a low business value for each one, MongoDB should fit;\n",
    "- when you need high availability in an unreliable environment (cloud and real life);\n",
    "- if you need to partition and shard your database, MongoDB has a built in easy solution for that;\n",
    "- when you want to get a good database and server administration, content management and delivery;\n",
    "- when your data is location based because of MongoDB has built-in spatial functions;\n",
    "- when your dataset is going to be big (starting from 1 GB) and schema is not stable.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\quad$ In the following lessons, we will show you a lot of instructive and clear examples (including real-world) after learning of which you will be able to easily decide when and (it is more important) how to use MongoDB in your projects. But now let’s install MongoDB server and all necessary elements on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and setup\n",
    "$\\quad$ We are approaching by small steps to the stage where we start using MongoDB in practice. But at first you need to install MongoDB at your computer.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ The instruction for installation of MongoDB on various operating systems are provided on [the official site of MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). Below we provide more universal instruction of MongoDB installation depending on your operating system.\n",
    "### Install on Linux and OS X\n",
    "1. Go to the MongoDB download page https://www.mongodb.com/download-center and choose you system.\n",
    "2. Download the archive and unzip it on your computer. Suppose you’ve downloaded it to /home/`<USER>`/Downloads folder, where `<USER>` is your user name.\n",
    "3. Open terminal (press Ctrl+Alt+T on Linux or Control+Option+Shift+T on MacOS) and run the following command (it starts a bash shell as a root level user. You need it because typically normal users can’t access /home/ directory):<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$ sudo bash`**\n",
    "4. We need to create a folder where MongoDB will save databases. For this we go up in top of the file system <br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$ cd /`**\n",
    "5. Then create the folder for database storaging<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$` mkdir -p /data/db**\n",
    "6. Also we need to add a permission to write data if we not login as root user<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$` chmod 777 /data**\n",
    "7. Same as before<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$` chmod 777 /data/db**\n",
    "8. Go to the folder with just downloaded file of installation. In our case it is /home/user_name/Downloads/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu1404-3.2.8/ and open /bin folder<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$ cd /home/<USER>/Downloads/mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu1404-3.2.8/bin`**\n",
    "9. Copy all files into /usr/local/bin<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$` cp * /usr/local/bin ** <br/>\n",
    "After running of all above steps you will have installed MongoDB on your Linux or MacOS. <br/> \n",
    "Let’s check whether all works fine. In terminal window (open new one if you’ve already closed it) write:<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$` mongod ** <br/>\n",
    "You should see the following text in the terminal:\n",
    "<img src=\"1470402788013.png\">\n",
    "To stop MongoDB, press Control+C in the terminal where the mongod instance is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install on Windows\n",
    "1. Go to the download page https://www.mongodb.com/download-center, choose you system.\n",
    "2. Download the msi file and install it.\n",
    "3. Go to Control Panel\\System and Security\\System → Advanced system settings → Advanced → Environment Variables\n",
    "<img src=\"1470393375203.png\">\n",
    "4. In System variables find “Path”, press “Edit” and add the path of installed MongoDB. Suppose you’ve installed MongoDB to C:\\Program Files, than you should paste<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`;C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\3.2\\bin`**<br/>\n",
    "to the “Path” variable (yes, semicolon should be there).\n",
    "5. Run console window (for example, press Win+R, type cmd and press Enter).\n",
    "6. MongoDB requires a data directory to store all data. MongoDB’s default data directory path is \\data\\db. Create this folder using the following commands from a Command Prompt<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`md \\data`**<br/>\n",
    "and<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`md \\data\\db`**<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, you should have MongoDB installed.<br/>\n",
    "To start MongoDB, run **mongod.exe.** For example, go to C:\\mongodb folder in the Command Prompt<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`> cd C:\\mongodb`**<br/>\n",
    "and then run mongod.exe<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`> bin\\mongod.exe`**<br/>\n",
    "<img src=\"1470728724866.png\">\n",
    "To stop MongoDB, press Control+C in the Command Prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mongo shell\n",
    "$\\quad$ Now you know what is MongoDB, for what it can be used and how to install it on your computer. In this section we describe how to run the simplest commands to get access to MongoDB databases.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ MongoDB provides an interactive interface for querying and updating data as well as performing administrative operations. It called **mongo shell.** The mongo shell is a component of the MongoDB distributions. Once you have installed and have started MongoDB, connect the mongo shell to your running MongoDB instance.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ To run mongo shell open terminal or command line depending on your OS and go to the folder where MongoDB was installed (see paragraph “Installation and setup“)<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`cd <mongodb installation dir>`**<br/>\n",
    "and type **./bin/mongo** to start mongo.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ To display the database you are currently using, write **db** in the terminal or command line. The operation should return **test**, which is the default database. To see all available and anywhere created databases type **show dbs** in the terminal or command line.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ We will not show any other commands in this lesson because it is the material for the next lessons. The aim of the current lesson is to show where they can be written. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Mongo API for Node.js\n",
    "$\\quad$ Besides mongo shell, MongoDB API support many programming language such as: Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, etc. Full list of languages you can see here http://api.mongodb.com. API (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) is a set of routine definitions, protocols, and tools for building software and applications. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. MongoDB provides an easy to use and very large set of commands for working with a database and its data.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ In this course we suppose you have a good knowledge of JavaScript, that’s why we will use MongDB API for JavaScript. To be more precise, it is API for Node.js - very powerful JavaScript-based framework/platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ Let's install Node.js. Below we provide the short instruction for installation of Node.js on Linux, MacOS and Windows.\n",
    "### Install Node.js on Linux\n",
    "1. Type the following command in your terminal:<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$` sudo apt-get install nodejs ** <br/>\n",
    "2. Then install the Node.js package manager, npm:<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$` sudo apt-get install npm ** <br/>\n",
    "3. Create a symbolic link for node, as many Node.js tools use this name to execute.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`** <br/>\n",
    "4. Now we should have both the Node and npm commands working. Check this displaying the version of Node.js<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$ node -v`** <br/>\n",
    "and npm<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$ npm -v`** <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Node.js on OS X and Windows\n",
    "1. Download the installer from http://nodejs.org/en/download.\n",
    "2. Run the installer Node.js and npm (the .msi or .pkg file you downloaded in the previous step) and follow the prompts in the installer.\n",
    "3. Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js until you restart your computer.\n",
    "4. Display the installed version of Node.js<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`> node - v`**<br/>\n",
    "and npm<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`> npm - v`**<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when Node.js is installed we need to install the MongoDB Node.js driver:<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$ npm install mongodb`** <br/>\n",
    "Now we ready to test our system. Run the mongodb if you turned it off:<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$ mongodb`** <br/>\n",
    "and connect to the MongoDB server through its API for Node.js. Create the file “test.js and past there the following code\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "    var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;\n",
    "    var assert = require('assert');\n",
    "    var url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test';\n",
    "    MongoClient.connect(url, function(err, db) {\n",
    "         assert.equal(null, err);\n",
    "         console.log(\"Connected correctly to server.\");\n",
    "         db.close();\n",
    "    });\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code import “mongodb” and “assert” modules. The second one is for displaying exceptions and errors messages if you cannot connect to MongoDB server. ***MongoClient*** creates a separate session for interaction with MongoDB server. We define  ***url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test'*** to set connection to a MongoDB instance that runs on the localhost interface on port 27017 and switch to the “test” database. ***connect*** method of MongoClient connects to MongoDB server with specific URL. All we do in this session is to display message that we were able to get access to “test” database. Note, that after all actions with a database with must close it to save all changes ***db.close().***<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ If you create the file just type in terminal:<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$ node test.js`** <br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ If you did everything right you will see \"Connected correctly to server.\" message in the terminal or command line.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ MongoDB APIs for Node.js possess with the full correspondence for native mongo shell syntax. There is a specific JavaScript library mongoose that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box. We aren’t going to use it in the course, but only meet you with alternatives for pure API for Node.js. To install **mongoose** you may use npm as it was done for mongodb library:<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad \\quad$ **`$ npm install mongoose`** <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "$\\quad$ The problem of storing and fast work with data in the modern world is one the most important problems. The time when the information storage was enough books are far behind. They were changed by databases and today the struggle between SQL and NoSQL databases is waging - which one is better and when.<br/>\n",
    "$\\quad$ In this lesson, we met you with both kinds of databases and its subtypes, show when they can be used and they storage data. But our closer look was put on of the most promising databases MongoDB. You’ve seen the difference how it collects data opposite to, particularly, SQL databases; how data is written to documents, documents are joined into collections and collections are combined into a database. We’ve laid a good basis for our further work and in the next lesson we are going to show how to create new databases, collections, and documents, fill them with data and apply a simple transformation to these data. Lessons will become only more interesting!"
